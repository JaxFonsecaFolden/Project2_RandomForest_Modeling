# Project2_RandomForest_Modeling

### *AML Predictive Modeling*
Contains data set explanation, feature engineering, and the Random Forest Modeling

### *Feature Discovery* 
This space is used to explore the datasets determining best practices for feature engineering

### *First Attmept*
Contains the first attempt of predictive modeling, without any features modification that would have any impact. All modifications were made for Random Forest limitations, and its need for numerical disinction.
